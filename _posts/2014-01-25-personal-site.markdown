Welcome to my personal site! The purpose of this site is mainly to showcase my CV in a pretty and interesting way. I also wanted to try out some tools and work on a site with less restriction in appearance. 
One of the tools that I wanted to try out was Jekyll. Jekyll is a liquid extension designed to help making sites, especially blog sites exceptionally easy to build. Liquid is a ruby program that parses markdown and Jekyll adds a bunch of useful tags and global variables. One of which is building the blog page you are reading right now.

Although I used it on the fly fishing website, I wanted to use bootstrap some more. There was a new version out but I also wanted to try their responsive layout. This page and all pages on this site should display correctly on mobile and all I had to do was nest everything in hundreds of divs. Jokes aside, bootstrap makes making cross media sites relatively painless. 

As for the future of this blog, this will likely be updated with news about technology, personal projects and anything that I find particularly interesting.
