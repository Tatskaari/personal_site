<h3>Work</h3>
<p>During my year in industry I worked for Fivium, a small software development company that specialises in web based application development. During my placement I was responsible for several projects for the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills. Here I will describe these projects and what roles I had in their development.</p>
<h4>ECO's Goods Checker Tool</h4>
<p>Early on in my placement I was tasked with designing a replacement for the Export Control Organisations goods checking tool. The tool was used to check an item that is intended for export against a list of controlled goods. During the project I was responsible for a large portion of the software delivery process including design, requirements gathering, development, training and even first line support while the tool was in user acceptance testing.</p>
