		<h4>Crawley Flyfishers Website</h4>
		<p>A website for the local charity Crawley Flyfishing Club. This was the first project that I worked on that required client facing. I have had to decipher what the client wants and what the client needs. I quickly learnt that the two are not necessarily the same thing.</p>

		<h4>A* path-finding</h4>
		<p>A* path-finding is a heuristic algorithm for finding the shortest path over a graph that I implemented in the unity game engine. During this project I had to implement a fairly complicated algorithm from pseudo code on the wikipedia page for the algorithm. This was a massive technical challenge that requires a keen interest in computing and maths in order to keep motivated to finish.</p>

		<h4>Heart of Yorikesh</h4>
		<p>I participated in the 2013 global game jam. This event is a 48 hour codeathon that games like surgeon simulator 2013 was produced. The theme that year was a soundtrack of a beating heart. I decided that you should search for Yorikesh's heart. The game consists of wandering through a dungeon following the sound of a beating heart. You can rotate dungeon tiles in order to navigate the dungeon which is randomly generated each time. The story of how the heart ended up in the dungeon is cryptically told through sprawling on the wall.</p>
