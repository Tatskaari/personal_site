<h4>Science!</h4>
<p>
	I love science. Mainly physics and mathematics however I also find the human body and chemistry facinating. I watch loads of edicational youtube videos by other people with similar interests.

<h4>Computing</h4>
<p>
	As a computer scientist, I kind of have to be interested in computers but I think my interst goes above and beyond the norm. I have been programming for many years, even before I started my course and I still can't stop coding, reading and learning.
